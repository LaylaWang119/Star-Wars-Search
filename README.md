# Star-Wars-Search
This project is a simple application to implement a web search portal for Star Wars in ReactJS.

It is able to search in three categories, i.e., films, people, and planets using SWAPI.

The Search Result is displayed in an infinite scrolling view, and more information can be viewed in a Popup window.

To run the application, first download the code to your desktop. Make sure you have npm in your computer, and then in the same directory run $ npm install in the npm command line prompt, this will install all the depedencies in package.json. After finishing instaling, run $ npm start and the app will be available in http://localhost:3000/ or http://192.168.86.197:3000/. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
